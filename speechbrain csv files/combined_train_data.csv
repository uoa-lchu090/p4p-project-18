197,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0265.wav,The manager immediately left the room to find a new nib.
198,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0267.wav,He flung his hat on to the huge bed and went towards her.
199,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0268.wav,And he had taken hold of the end of her ostrich feather boa.
200,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0269.wav,I saw a beautiful umbrella broken in half like that on my way over.
201,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0271.wav,I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of cocoa in the tin.
202,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0272.wav,He felt awfully out of it.
203,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0273.wav,"Calm yourself, she said superbly."
204,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0275.wav,she raised her pale eyebrows until they rippled away into her pale hair.
205,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0276.wav,"Olive, pet, said Laura, looking over her shoulder."
206,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0277.wav,It was the heavy piano being moved on its stiff castors.
207,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0279.wav,it was muffled as though the dog had its head in a sack.
208,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0280.wav,"and a quick, bold, evil feeling started up in her breast."
209,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0281.wav,"She was a long, strange-looking woman with narrow hands and feet."
210,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0283.wav,He only woke up once last night.
211,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0284.wav,First man in as usual.
212,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0285.wav,And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist.
213,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0287.wav,He paused by the window and glanced at her a moment over his shoulder.
214,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0288.wav,She saw with joy that his eyes were full of tears.
215,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0289.wav,"She struggled, and was quite amazed to realise how angry she felt."
216,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0291.wav,"Squatting on her heels, Viola opened the letter."
217,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0292.wav,But by that time she had to peg out the washing for the Frau.
218,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0293.wav,"After all, dash it, they were young still."
219,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0295.wav,"Fastidiously, his lips curling, Andreas picked his way through the water."
220,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0296.wav,is it rather the curse of my genius.
221,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0297.wav,"Her loud, slightly harsh voice filled the salon."
222,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0299.wav,I make no secret of my age.
223,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0300.wav,That young man I refuse to converse with.
224,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0301.wav,Surely you have had more adventures than any man in Germany.
225,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0303.wav,"Frau Hartmann, I congratulate you."
226,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0304.wav,and the greetings were so long and loud that I felt a sympathetic glow.
227,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0305.wav,"They sway and languish dreamily, And we, close pressed, are kissing there."
228,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0307.wav,"Such reserve, such a tender way with the child."
229,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0308.wav,"I order double portions, and eat them in peace."
230,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0309.wav,I found myself pitying the Baron.
231,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0311.wav,But you never have large families in England now.
232,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0312.wav,The carriage gates were pushed back.
233,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0313.wav,"No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and such lips."
234,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0315.wav,"Glad to be home again, dearie."
235,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0316.wav,His heart was wrung with such a spasm that he could have cried out.
236,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0317.wav,It was as much part of the lesson as opening the piano.
237,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0319.wav,It was glaring bright and stifling.
238,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0320.wav,"Oh, what a loathsome thing to have done."
239,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0321.wav,The servants were talking as if they were alone in the house.
240,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0323.wav,Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed.
241,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0324.wav,The result looked like a gigantic dustbin.
242,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0325.wav,She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too.
243,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0327.wav,"How wrong, how wicked, feeling as I do."
244,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0328.wav,The very idea of such a thing was preposterous.
245,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0329.wav,a jolt might have done it so easily.
246,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0331.wav,Four men in their shirt-sleeves stood grouped together on the garden path.
247,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0332.wav,Why is it so exciting to be awake when everybody else is asleep.
248,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0333.wav,"Heaven reward thy sweet patience, lady mine, he murmured."
249,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0335.wav,"And somewhere, far away, grandma was lighting a lamp."
250,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0336.wav,"Alice gave a loud, silly little titter."
251,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0337.wav,"said old Mrs. Fairfield, setting her cap straight."
252,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0339.wav,"Yes, that was her real grudge against life."
253,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0340.wav,He could not be disloyal.
254,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0341.wav,And when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour.
255,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0343.wav,"They were the Trout boys, Pip and Rags."
256,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0344.wav,No time to say good-bye.
257,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0345.wav,There ahead was stretched the sandy road with shallow puddles.
258,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0347.wav,I just saw her go out to buy some.
259,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0348.wav,Was it possible that the strange man was still there.
260,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0349.wav,Why on earth had she asked him to wait a moment.
261,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0351.wav,Ignorance must not go uncontradicted.
262,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0352.wav,Eight kilometres it must be.
263,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0353.wav,"Oh, what a beautiful, noble idea."
264,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0355.wav,Allow me to introduce you to each other.
265,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0356.wav,"Yes, nodding graciously to the Advanced Lady."
266,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0357.wav,"shouted Hans, hitting Anton over the head with his empty cup."
267,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0359.wav,There was a gentle knock at the door and his mother came in.
268,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0360.wav,Then you are an Englishwoman.
269,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0361.wav,"Then, presumably, the winged shaft struck her collar brooch."
270,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0363.wav,But you cannot equal their dress materials.
271,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0364.wav,But doubtless they have not the same symbolical value for the English.
272,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0365.wav,This is my little English friend of whom I have spoken.
273,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0367.wav,The quantity of fruit I have eaten on this bench he sighed.
274,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0368.wav,That is almost a mouthful in itself.
275,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0369.wav,"He tilted back in his chair, chuckling with laughter."
276,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0371.wav,Now they had five babies and twice as much money.
277,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0372.wav,Which resolution comforted her absolutely.
278,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0373.wav,"But I consider child-bearing the most ignominious of all professions, I said."
279,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0375.wav,A chestnut tree pushed green boughs against the window.
280,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0376.wav,I am not accustomed to such company.
281,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0377.wav,Her high-born reply was what interested me.
282,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0379.wav,we gorged on scandals of High Birth generously buttered.
283,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0380.wav,Followed a complete and deathlike silence.
284,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0381.wav,he is not at all particular about his food.
285,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0383.wav,I must be back in London in September.
286,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0384.wav,Who ever heard of having children upon vegetables.
287,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0385.wav,I have not eaten meat for three years.
288,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0387.wav,They were ever so kind to me.
289,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0388.wav,she looked at Ethel over her spectacles.
290,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0389.wav,"And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, All men ought to have hobbies."
291,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0391.wav,That might have brought her nearer.
292,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0392.wav,Her airy little voice mocked him.
293,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0393.wav,He bent over her and she looked up with her familiar half-smile.
294,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0395.wav,Love me as little as you like.
295,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0396.wav,"The willow trees, outside the high, narrow windows, waved in the wind."
296,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0397.wav,his teeth gleamed when he smiled.
297,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0399.wav,And when Leila compared him with her other partners he looked shabby.
298,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0400.wav,It gave her quite a shock again to see how old he was.
299,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0401.wav,Meg passed him on to Leila.
300,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0403.wav,"Strange voices answered, Of course, my dear."
301,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0404.wav,Two old women in white aprons ran up and down tossing fresh armfuls.
302,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0405.wav,The third and the ninth as usual.
303,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0407.wav,"It must have had a knock, somehow."
304,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0408.wav,One Golden Hour Set with Sixty Diamond Minutes.
305,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0409.wav,now a gull flipped by.
306,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0411.wav,He clasped grandma in his arms and pressed her to him.
307,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0412.wav,She pressed her eyes with her knuckles and rocked to and fro.
308,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0413.wav,I thought they were only for servants.
309,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0415.wav,"Look here, said William, how are we going to sit."
310,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0416.wav,"May thy head, William, lack not ointment."
311,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0417.wav,"He touched her cool hand, her cool cheek."
312,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0419.wav,We are inclined to reconsider.
313,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0420.wav,It would frighten Ethel out of her life.
314,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0421.wav,Then she tied her apron and sat down to take off her boots.
315,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0423.wav,Ma Parker gave no answer.
316,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0424.wav,And then we were outside again.
317,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0425.wav,"I sipped my tea, leaned back, and even asked if I might smoke."
318,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0427.wav,When a faint violin sounded she winced and bit her lip again.
319,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0428.wav,Are they allowed to take dogs in there.
320,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0429.wav,How can you talk of cutting off now.
321,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0431.wav,And I do believe I know why I make you laugh.
322,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0432.wav,Biddy lay down with her tongue poked out.
323,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0433.wav,it was the shadow from the tree outside.
324,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0435.wav,"And this time, said Josephine firmly, we must come to a definite decision."
325,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0436.wav,"We were sure you are, too."
326,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0437.wav,It would be somehow so satisfactory.
327,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0439.wav,Their cold lips quivered at the greenish brims.
328,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0440.wav,the cab was dreadfully stuffy.
329,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0441.wav,And do you expect me to pay for this gimcrack excursion of yours.
330,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0443.wav,"We can decide to-morrow, she said."
331,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0444.wav,He was given up to his dream.
332,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0445.wav,"His head was sunk in the pillow, his eyes were closed."
333,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0447.wav,Men hung over the palings.
334,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0448.wav,People of that class are so impressed by arum lilies.
335,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0449.wav,"No, wait, take the arum lilies too."
336,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0451.wav,And somehow that seemed quite the best plan.
337,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0452.wav,"But it all seemed blurred, unreal, like a picture in the newspaper."
338,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0453.wav,then the children were unbuttoned.
339,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0455.wav,But still one must go everywhere.
340,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0456.wav,She looked mournfully and enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in.
341,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0457.wav,But at that moment Mrs. Sheridan joined them.
342,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0459.wav,How very nice workmen were.
343,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0460.wav,"Let us live our life, all new, all ours, from the very beginning."
344,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0461.wav,My very own for ever.
345,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0463.wav,She had no idea that he was grey.
346,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0464.wav,"No guiding principle, let us call it."
347,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0465.wav,"He was always full of new ideas, schemes, plans."
348,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0467.wav,"It must be awful, she said slowly."
349,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0468.wav,The blinds were being pulled down.
350,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0469.wav,He charged over the table and seemed to eat the cards up.
351,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0471.wav,It happens to all of us sooner or later.
352,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0472.wav,it was as though a little piece of forked lightning was imprisoned in it.
353,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0473.wav,"she breathed in a small whisper to the boy, Hallo, my funny."
354,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0475.wav,He waved his arms foolishly at his mother.
355,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0476.wav,The boy had turned over.
356,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0477.wav,he could not tell a lie.
357,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0479.wav,"but, drawing off one stocking and then the other, she felt a little beauty."
358,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0480.wav,"Of course there were stories, but such stories."
359,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0481.wav,he ignored his wife just as she ignored him.
360,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0483.wav,To think I should talk to a man like that.
361,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0484.wav,"She smiled, and a look of deep content shone in her eyes."
362,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0485.wav,As Stanley helped himself his blue eyes widened.
363,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0487.wav,Then something immense came into view.
364,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0488.wav,the same soaking bushes showed on either side and the same shadowy palings.
365,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0489.wav,there was nothing to mark which was beach and where was the sea.
366,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0491.wav,"Why, even a prostitute has a greater sense of generosity."
367,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0492.wav,"but, in view of a premeditated journey together, we became delightfully cordial."
368,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0493.wav,Hang your coat on the landing and shake yourself over the banisters.
369,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0495.wav,"No thanks, he said grimly."
370,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0496.wav,"she snarled, and swooping over she fastened her teeth in his glove."
371,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0497.wav,There was no man to disturb them.
372,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0499.wav,She broke off a little pink petal and smiled at it.
373,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0500.wav,In that moment together in the passage a miracle had happened.
374,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0501.wav,That was the life for her.
375,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0503.wav,"Well, that had been a fascinating interlude."
376,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0504.wav,From the road a sudden shout of triumph.
377,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0505.wav,"My dear little lady, you must not take the quotation literally."
378,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0507.wav,"Rather, under the lying garb of false masculinity."
379,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0508.wav,She creates that she may destroy.
380,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0509.wav,What right have they even to question each other.
381,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0511.wav,"Da, that child has such energy."
382,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0512.wav,The Frau Professor is going to be one of us for the afternoon.
383,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0513.wav,Shall we join the others.
384,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0515.wav,such great big black trees on either side.
385,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0516.wav,their cry sounded in the dreams of little children.
386,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0517.wav,Whatever would it look like when she carried two babies so.
387,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0519.wav,My insides are all twisted up with having children too quickly.
388,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0520.wav,Then come in when I call you and help me cut up the salad.
389,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0521.wav,"Standing on tiptoe in the yard, she almost felt she would be blown away."
390,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0523.wav,In a corner of the room the Man was fastening his braces.
391,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0524.wav,He began to plan a little trip for them.
392,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0525.wav,Marriage certainly changed a woman far more than it did a man.

394,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0528.wav,"He took up a book, and wheeled his arm-chair over to the window."
395,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0529.wav,"Wind crept round the house, moaning drearily."
396,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0531.wav,Tell me on the way up.
397,./training/Mansfield_train/akl_nz_cw_0532.wav,Her easy acceptance pleased him.
