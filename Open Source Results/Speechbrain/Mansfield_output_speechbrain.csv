uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0186.wav,THE VERY IDEA MADE ONE SHUDDER
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0370.wav,BEING INTERPRETED IT MEANT SINGLE FILE WHICH WAS DISTRESSING FOR ELSA AND PRINCE
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0035.wav,A NICE SHAKE UP IN THE BUS NEVER IMPROVED HIS APPETITE
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0402.wav,BUT THE MASTER GAVE HER NO OPENING
uoa_nz_mansfield_sj_0574.wav,THE LITTLE SQUAT HAND WITH THE BRASS AND TURQUOISE RING FORCES THE RELUCTANT FLUTE
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0340.wav,THE LITTLE GIRLS RAN INTO THE PADDOCK LIKE CHICKENS THAT OUT OF A COOP
