uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0263.wav,1 golden hour set of 60 diamond minutes.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0264.wav,"Dear lying to one side on an immense bed, late Grandpa."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0265.wav,But Grandma remembered too. At the same time.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0266.wav,Such a very nice stewardess came to meet them.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0267.wav,Grandma made a small astonished face.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0268.wav,He clasped grandma in his arms and pressed her to him.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0269.wav,"Beside him, her grandma bustled along and her ********* black Ulster."

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0272.wav,You think they are another bad sign?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0273.wav,We are inclined to reconsider.

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0275.wav,My Parker gave no answer.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0276.wav,Will you stay in the car while I go and look?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0277.wav,And then we were outside again.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0278.wav,"I skipped my tea, leaned back, and even asked if I might smoke."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0279.wav,Ohh well there seems nowhere else said she.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0280.wav,How can you talk of cutting off now?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0281.wav,"Ohh, if you only knew how hard I feel."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0282.wav,And where are you going? If your mother may ask?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0283.wav,It was the shadow from the tree outside.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0284.wav,"Well, we can't postpone it again, said Josephine."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0285.wav,Ohh X in various forms.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0286.wav,"And this time, said Josephine firmly, we must come to a different decision."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0287.wav,She raised her pale eyebrows until they rippled away into a pale hair.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0288.wav,Ask Josephine trying to begin to concentrate.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0289.wav,I'm afraid I shan't be able to stay very long with Grandfather.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0290.wav,But we mustn't let you off of that.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0291.wav,It would be somehow so satisfactory.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0292.wav,The cab was dreadfully stuffy.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0293.wav,She heard his stick thumping.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0294.wav,"We can't disturb Kate again, she said softly."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0295.wav,A spasm of pity squeezed her heart.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0296.wav,He was given up to his dream.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0297.wav,Run down just as you are.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0298.wav,And somehow that seemed quite the best plan.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0299.wav,Mrs. Sheridan got up and came over to her carrying the hat.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0300.wav,What's given you such a colour?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0301.wav,Jose began to be seriously annoyed.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0302.wav,But still one must go everywhere.

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0304.wav,She looked mournfully and enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0305.wav,Let's try over. This life is weary.

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0315.wav,He lit across a flower bed and seized her in his arms.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0316.wav,I must go sick those ears to my fame and fortune.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0317.wav,"No guiding principle, let us call it."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0318.wav,I'm exactly like that insect again.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0319.wav,Why don't I fly out again?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0320.wav,"He was always full of new ideas, schemes, plans."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0321.wav,Would ye have me laugh my fair sister?

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0326.wav,"Alice did wish they'd been a bit of life on the road, though."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0327.wav,I've never seen anyone so eaten.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0328.wav,But still her grandma was silent.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0329.wav,"Grandma, she said in a startled voice."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0330.wav,"And how strong, how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot sun?"
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0331.wav,We know all about that.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0332.wav,"But she checked herself and said to the boy coldly, I don't like babies."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0333.wav,The boy had turned over.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0334.wav,And she gave a strange name laugh and grimaced at the other woman.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0335.wav,"Of course there were stories, but such stories."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0336.wav,He ignored his wife just as she ignored him.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0337.wav,But aren't you going to bathe here?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0338.wav,Then the children were unbuttoned.

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0349.wav,This mania for conversation irritated Stanley beyond words.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0350.wav,But Jonathan was a match for him.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0351.wav,The same soaking bushes showed on either side and the same shadowy palings.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0352.wav,There was nothing to mark which for speech and where was to see.

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0354.wav,I sent him home to change his clothes.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0355.wav,She struggled and was quite amazed to realise how angry she felt.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0356.wav,"Yes, I'm not busy tomorrow, she said."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0357.wav,Was it possible that the strange man was still there?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0358.wav,There was delight for her.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0359.wav,"Well, there had been a fascinating interlude."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0360.wav,Drops of water fell from her hair onto the paper.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0361.wav,"No, she's not living here answered, Viola."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0362.wav,8 kilometres it must be.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0363.wav,From the road a sudden shout of triumph.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0364.wav,"My dear little lady, you must not take the quotation literally."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0365.wav,What is it your Shakespeare says?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0366.wav,Ohh because they live close to the Earth and therefore the spice it.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0367.wav,"Rather, under the lying gap of false masculinity."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0368.wav,What right have they even to question each other?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0369.wav,Fritz escaped that truly Christian trap by saying I asked you first.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0370.wav,"Being interpreted, it meant single file, which was distressing for Elsa and Fritz."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0371.wav,We March on mass along the station Rd.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0372.wav,Duh. That child has such energy.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0373.wav,Allow me to introduce you to each other.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0374.wav,"Yes, nodding graciously to the advanced lady."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0375.wav,The fraud professor is going to be one of us for the afternoon.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0376.wav,Shall we join the others?

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0378.wav,"For us, she said there will be a double joy."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0379.wav,You not crying anymore or wake up in the night.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0380.wav,Such great big black trees on either side.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0381.wav,Once Upon a time she was walking along a little white Rd with O.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0382.wav,There was a little piece of candle burning in the enamel bracket.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0383.wav,They were laughing and holding each other by the hand.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0384.wav,"Standing on tiptoe in the yard, she almost felt she would be blown away."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0385.wav,That's why I'm not awake.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0386.wav,Don't guzzle it yourself or I'll know.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0387.wav,"Well, she's hooked a boy this time."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0388.wav,"He'd have to force her out of it, that's all."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0389.wav,He began to plan a little trip for them.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0390.wav,"Well, once it's boy business was over, she'd get stronger."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0391.wav,She certainly was a little thing.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0392.wav,"They stood something in him, those bells, something vague and tender."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0393.wav,Asked Andreas loathing the man.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0394.wav,No time to indulge in pernicious little habits.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0395.wav,He took up a book and wheeled his armchair over to the window.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0396.wav,"The doctor was slowed, a little tune and flicked the mirror again."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0397.wav,Tell me on the way up.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0398.wav,"On Sunday, a man has the right to expect his family."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0399.wav,It's partly the effect of Sunday.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0400.wav,"Two dogs sprawled in the middle of the road, scuffling and biting."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0401.wav,The gutters were choked with the leavings of Saturday night.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0402.wav,But the master gave her no opening.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0403.wav,She was full of terrified joy and importance in the goings on upstairs.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0404.wav,I suppose I better not disturb her.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0405.wav,There was a gentle knock at the door and his mother came in.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0406.wav,He repeated it quickly several times over snapping movement of the draws.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0407.wav,What are you going to do this afternoon? Fraulein Anna.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0408.wav,Fancy she has a separate plate for each of her front teeth.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0409.wav,She turned round and leaned on one elbow.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0410.wav,It makes such a pleasant excursion for a fine Saturday afternoon.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0411.wav,A high wooden wall compasses us all about.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0412.wav,"I think it must be the umbrellas, which make us look ridiculous."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0413.wav,He was someone beside her laughing too.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0414.wav,"But the outer door suddenly opening, she sprang to her feet and laughed."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0415.wav,She brushed out her long hair and gathered it in her hands.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0416.wav,"Well you are a funny one, she said."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0417.wav,"You go downstairs, leave me alone."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0418.wav,Sabina took on the extra work without any thoughts of extra pay.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0419.wav,It meant an extra half hour in bed for her.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0420.wav,And I do not see any possible light out of this darkness.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0421.wav,But what a bother said I.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0422.wav,"Thus, the modern soul and I found ourselves together under the stars."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0423.wav,My spirit starts for want of that.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0424.wav,He was off duty and intended to show it.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0425.wav,Then presumably the wind shaft struck a colour brooch.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0426.wav,"Yes, I know you have no love for me and no, forget me not."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0427.wav,"What do you intend to recite? Fraud line, Sonia."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0428.wav,I forget nothing. Mama answered Sonia.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0429.wav,My lament husband. Your father Sonia knew a great deal about England.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0430.wav,But the tragedy of the story is this.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0431.wav,The conversation is not out of your depth.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0432.wav,I have been making music for them on my trombone.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0433.wav,The children were all soundly sleeping.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0434.wav,"God did trouble, you gave me."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0435.wav,"He tilted back in his chair, chuckling with laughter."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0436.wav,It's not religion to love to men.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0437.wav,He was a traveller and only stayed at their house two nights.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0438.wav,He winked at the guests who broke into loud laughter.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0439.wav,It was easier when they came into the village.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0440.wav,"So young and yet to suffer so cruelly, she murmured."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0441.wav,"Then dear child, where's your husband?"
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0442.wav,You look like a little Persian kitten.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0443.wav,That is a very nice idea.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0444.wav,There's a piece of that beautiful flannel petticoat. You lift us last summer.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0445.wav,"The wash then has of course, been scrapped over with soda."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0446.wav,Are there many people here just now?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0447.wav,"How you keep them all, I don't know."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0448.wav,Bertha turning to the youngest of the five. How changed?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0449.wav,And the greetings were so long and loud that I felt a sympathetic glow.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0450.wav,How I should adore to kiss you murmured the student.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0451.wav,Was love then a question of manicure?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0452.wav,I picked up my ears.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0453.wav,She sighed and turned up her eyes.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0454.wav,And fancy now she has already had six proposals of marriage.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0455.wav,I have written these lines.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0456.wav,He fixed a Stony eye on her and she blushed.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0457.wav,Such reserve such a tender way with the child.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0458.wav,To my plebian eyes that afflicted child was singularly unattractive.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0459.wav,The manager immediately left the room to find a new nib.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0460.wav,But the child is dumb venture the manager apologetically.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0461.wav,There was a picture of her only last week in sport and Salon.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0462.wav,"I have only received the letter, acquainting me with the fact this morning."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0463.wav,"When we arrived at the pension, there was very nearly an open riot."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0464.wav,A wise idea I answered.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0465.wav,I fear he said that my luggage will be damp.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0466.wav,But he himself volunteered some information.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0467.wav,Together we walked through the mud and slush.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0468.wav,Who could tell what the future held?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0469.wav,Followed a complete and deaf like silence.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0470.wav,Suddenly the door opened and admitted to Baron.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0471.wav,Never had I seen him at the casino or the above establishment.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0472.wav,"At the end of the meal, we were served with coffee."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0473.wav,There was a lady from the Spanish court here in the summer.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0474.wav,I closed the door after me.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0475.wav,But you cannot be in earnest.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0476.wav,This morning I took a half bath.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0477.wav,"Of course, she was very proud."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0478.wav,I can make very good tea.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0479.wav,Do they really eat so much?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0480.wav,Nothing at all cried here. Hoffman from Berlin.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0481.wav,"There he goes again, thought Andreas earring off his knowledge."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0482.wav,"Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling shared a warm, bright light."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0483.wav,I don't know how far I didn't run.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0484.wav,The little dressing table and mirror at the far end.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0485.wav,A bell sounded far over the water.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0486.wav,Stenny lifted up to see a dark haired bobbing far out and an arm lifted.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0487.wav,I've had my Easter lilies with a gorgeous star.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0488.wav,Some dreadful man tried to kiss her at the club ball.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0489.wav,That had been a rule for years never to disturb father in the morning.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0490.wav,I imbibed nourishment in my room.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0491.wav,They took it for granted. It was your job to slave away for them.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0492.wav,I too know of much joy.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0493.wav,"But in the afternoon, six or seven choice spirits played cards."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0494.wav,Not to have cared enough to scratch. How that would disgust.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0495.wav,He too felt his bath was spoilt.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0496.wav,The other graphs are beautifully smooth yellow stick.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0497.wav,"This soft swish of the sea full tide, sweeping the pebbles."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0498.wav,"Breathless, half choking. She told the dreadful story."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0499.wav,Clasping the old fish bag that held her cleaning things.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0500.wav,You might have seen a big fish flicking in at the window and gone again.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0501.wav,And quite big girls older than me even were riding them.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0502.wav,That looked at low tide like shaggy beasts come down to the water to drink.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0503.wav,She saw her great big shadow on the wall.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0504.wav,The thing to do was to let Kashmir go on his wild goose chase.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0505.wav,The second best run. She urged knowing perfectly well she was telling a story.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0506.wav,I wonder if any air enters by the ears.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0507.wav,Wasn't there anywhere in the world where she could have her cry out?
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0508.wav,"When I was their age, I used to go to bed, hugging an old towel with a knot in it."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0509.wav,With little red shadows and blue bridles and belts gained a jingling on their ears.

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0513.wav,We could manage our own food.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0514.wav,"The three little girls appeared, each carrying a parched plate."

uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0518.wav,"You sit down on the side of your bed, change your shoes, and dash out again."
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0519.wav,Suddenly it was a terrible effort to greet as usual.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0520.wav,And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down in this flights.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0521.wav,Walking on again with a little air of remoteness.
uoa_nz_mansfield_jh_0522.wav,"Old, Mr Nieve got up and went to join that little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing room."

uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0167.wav,"No, she said I won't go outside."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0168.wav,"No, she said I won't go outside."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0169.wav,How strange should never thought of it like that before?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0170.wav,They sat outside the house in long chairs under coloured parasols.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0171.wav,"We shall have to anoint ourselves with butter, said Dennis."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0172.wav,He touched her cool hand her cool cheek.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0173.wav,It would frighten Ethel out of her life.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0174.wav,She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0175.wav,But it was a charming air.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0176.wav,She put the big frothing cups before them and pushed across my clear glass.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0177.wav,"When a faint violin sounded, she winced and bit her lip again."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0178.wav,"Calm yourself, she said superbly."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0179.wav,"How long, how wicked feeling as I do?"
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0180.wav,He tried to smile. To say I'm glad.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0181.wav,"It is tomorrow that you're going, isn't it?"
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0182.wav,"But his luck gave him a nasty jar, to say the least, almost immediately."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0183.wav,It was 35 years old.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0184.wav,"But at that moment in the street below, a barrel organ struck up."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0185.wav,They are such awfully nice men.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0186.wav,The very idea made one shudder.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0187.wav,I've got the name somewhere on the back of an envelope.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0188.wav,She had no idea that he was grey.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0189.wav,That's a more intolerable situation than the other.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0190.wav,But Jonathan only answered a little love a little kindness.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0191.wav,She hated her grandma to be sad.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0192.wav,He could not be disloyal.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0193.wav,"And when you turned it over, the outside was a deep bronze colour."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0194.wav,"They were the trout boys, pip and rags."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0195.wav,No time to say goodbye.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0196.wav,You haven't been using it to poke the kitchen fire with by any chance?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0197.wav,Their cry sounded in the dreams of little children.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0198.wav,And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0199.wav,Then something immense came into view.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0200.wav,Why even a prostitute has a greater sense of generosity?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0201.wav,He paused by the window and glanced at her a moment over his shoulder.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0202.wav,What does the Pussycat do all day?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0203.wav,I just saw her go out to buy some.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0204.wav,"They had looked at each other, stunned with the conflict and sympathised."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0205.wav,I know no such name in a sharp voice.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0206.wav,You look like a little boy with your hair blowing about in the wind.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0207.wav,"Ohh, what a beautiful noble idea."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0208.wav,"As you please, said the landlord obviously scorning us."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0209.wav,But by that time she had to peg out the washing for the frow.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0210.wav,Shouted hands hitting Anton over the head with his empty cup.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0211.wav,She's got twice the nerve of you and me rolled into one.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0212.wav,He wore an immense geranium flower stuck in the lapel of his coat.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0213.wav,"Straight away, Andreas felt that he was being accused."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0214.wav,"From the pine forests streamed wild perfume, the branches swayed together rhythmically."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0215.wav,Then you are an English woman.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0216.wav,"Ohh I spend the day here now, she answered."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0217.wav,What a fire. She shrieked. Stretching out her hands.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0218.wav,"Ohh Mama, please don't say such things Sonia flushed and grew very angry."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0219.wav,Such a brilliant way of putting things.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0220.wav,This is my little English friend of whom I have spoken.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0221.wav,Such a cloud on the air as you gave me?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0222.wav,Her roughened hands clasped and unclasped themselves in the folds of her skirt.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0223.wav,"That's not how a wedding should be, she said."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0224.wav,You must tuck the ends into your boots until we get there.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0225.wav,"But I consider child bearing the most ignominious of all professions, I said."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0226.wav,I said he was a sea captain on a long and perilous voyage.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0227.wav,"When I meet new people, I squeeze them dry like a sponge."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0228.wav,A chestnut tree pushed green bows against the window.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0229.wav,I am not accustomed to such company.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0230.wav,He and frail Fischer were old friends.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0231.wav,You do not seem to enjoy discussing the functions of the body.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0232.wav,Her high born reply was what interested me.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0233.wav,Youth should be like a wild rose.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0234.wav,Coffee and rolls took on the nature of an ****.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0235.wav,Afflicted children have such pretty ways.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0236.wav,"I really do not know, I answered."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0237.wav,"I assure you, we are not afraid."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0238.wav,How long are you remaining here?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0239.wav,Whoever heard of having children upon vegetables?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0240.wav,I have not eaten meat for three years.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0241.wav,My lady put me into collars and cuffs from the 1st.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0242.wav,They were ever so kind to me.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0243.wav,"Come along, I'd say come along and I'll layout your patience for you."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0244.wav,But it's always boiling before my lady is half through.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0245.wav,She looked at Ethel over her spectacles.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0246.wav,The carriage gates were pushed back.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0247.wav,They are hard to resist.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0248.wav,They are eagerly bought by the soldiers.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0249.wav,"She lay on his breast, but so lightly so remotely."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0250.wav,He bent over her and she looked up with her familiar half smile.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0251.wav,His heart was wrung with such a spasm that he could have cried out.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0252.wav,He was something between the sheepdog and the shepherd.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0253.wav,As much expression as you can put into it.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0254.wav,"The Willow trees outside the high, narrow windows waved in the wind."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0255.wav,She didn't even recognise him again.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0256.wav,"And when Layla compared him with her other partners, he looked shabby."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0257.wav,It gave her quite a shock again to see how old he was.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0258.wav,Drawled a faint voice close to her ear.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0259.wav,Meg passed him on to Layla.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0260.wav,There was a joyful flutter among the girls.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0261.wav,"Strange voices answered, of course, my dear."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0262.wav,It must have had a knock somehow.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0263.wav,1 golden Hour set with 60 diamond minutes.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0264.wav,They're lying to one side on an immense bed. Lay grandpa.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0265.wav,But Grandma remembered too. At the same time.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0266.wav,Such a very nice stewardess came to meet them.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0267.wav,Grandma made a small astonished face.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0268.wav,He clasped grandma in his arms and pressed her to him.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0269.wav,"Beside him, her grandma bustled along in her ********* black Ulster."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0270.wav,"Look here, said William, how are we going to sit?"
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0271.wav,May thy head William lack not ointment.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0272.wav,You think they are another bad sign?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0273.wav,We are inclined to reconsider.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0274.wav,Mark Parker through the Counterpane over the bed.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0275.wav,Mark Parker gave no answer.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0276.wav,Will you stay in the car while I go and look?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0277.wav,And then we were outside again.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0278.wav,"I skipped my tea, leaned back, and even asked if I might smoke."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0279.wav,Ohh well there seems nowhere else said she.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0280.wav,How can you talk of cutting off now?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0281.wav,"Ohh, if you only knew how horrid I feel."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0282.wav,And where are you going? If your mother may ask?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0283.wav,It was the shadow from the tree outside.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0284.wav,"Well, we can't postpone it again, said Josephine."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0285.wav,Ohh eggs in various forms.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0286.wav,"And this time, said Josephine firmly, we must come to a definite decision."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0287.wav,She raised her pale eyebrows until they rippled away into her pale hair.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0288.wav,Ask Josephine trying to begin to concentrate.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0289.wav,I'm afraid I shan't be able to stay very long with Grandfather.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0290.wav,But we mustn't let you off with that.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0291.wav,It would be somehow so satisfactory.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0292.wav,The cab was dreadfully stuffy.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0293.wav,She heard his stick thumping.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0294.wav,"We can't disturb Kate again, she said softly."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0295.wav,A spasm of pity squeezed her heart.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0296.wav,He was given up to his dream.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0297.wav,Run down just as you are.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0298.wav,And somehow that seemed quite the best plan.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0299.wav,Missus Sheridan got up and came over to her carrying the hat.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0300.wav,What's given you such a colour?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0301.wav,Joe's began to be seriously annoyed.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0302.wav,But still one must go everywhere.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0303.wav,"Sadie had her hand clapped to her cheek, as though she had toothache."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0304.wav,She looked mournfully and enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0305.wav,Let's try over. This life is weary.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0306.wav,"But at that moment, Mrs. Sheridan joined them."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0307.wav,It was the heavy piano being moved on its stiff casters.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0308.wav,How very nice workmen were.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0309.wav,But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0310.wav,You enjoy yourself while you're young.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0311.wav,"Let us live our life all new, all ours, from the very beginning."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0312.wav,My very own forever.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0313.wav,Ohh what a joy it is to own things.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0314.wav,I've had the hell of a day.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0315.wav,He leapt across the flower bed and seized her in his arms.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0316.wav,I must go seek those ears to my fame and fortune.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0317.wav,"No guiding principle, let us call it."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0318.wav,I'm exactly like that insect again.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0319.wav,Why don't I fly out again?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0320.wav,"He was always full of new ideas, schemes, plans."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0321.wav,Would he have me laugh my fair sister?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0322.wav,"It must be awful, she said slowly."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0323.wav,Greeting my social Peach blossom.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0324.wav,The gorgeous sunset had blazed and died.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0325.wav,Whatever did we shut the door for?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0326.wav,"Alice did wish they'd been a bit of life on the road, though."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0327.wav,I never seen anyone so eaten.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0328.wav,But still her grandma was silent.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0329.wav,"Grandma, she said in a startled voice."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0330.wav,"And how strong, how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot sun?"
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0331.wav,We know all about that.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0332.wav,"But she checked herself and said to the boy coldly, I don't like babies."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0333.wav,The boy had turned over.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0334.wav,And she gave her strange naming laugh and grimaced at the other women.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0335.wav,"Of course there were stories, but such stories."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0336.wav,He ignored his wife just as she ignored him.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0337.wav,But aren't you going to bathe here?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0338.wav,Then the children were unbuttoned.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0339.wav,This one was as big as a star and far more beautiful.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0340.wav,The little girls ran into the paddock like chickens let out of a coop.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0341.wav,There was number man to disturb them.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0342.wav,They're very voices were changed as they called to one another.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0343.wav,Why can't you eat your food properly like Isabel and Lottie?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0344.wav,She smiled and a look of deep content shone in her eyes.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0345.wav,He only woke up once last night.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0346.wav,They settled themselves on the bench opposite Stanley and Beryl.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0347.wav,They were dressed alike in blue jerseys and knickers.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0348.wav,"As Stanley helped himself, his blue eyes widened."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0349.wav,This mania for conversation irritated Stanley beyond words.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0350.wav,But Jonathan was a match for him.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0351.wav,The same soaking bushes showed on either side and the same shadowy palings.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0352.wav,There was nothing to mark which was beach. And where was the sea?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0353.wav,The Garden party by Katherine Mansfield.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0354.wav,I sent him home to change his clothes.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0355.wav,She struggled and was quite amazed to realise how angry she felt.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0356.wav,"Yes, I'm not busy tomorrow, she said."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0357.wav,Was it possible that the strange man was still there?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0358.wav,That was the life for her.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0359.wav,"Well, that had been a fascinating interlude."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0360.wav,Drops of water fell from her hair onto the paper.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0361.wav,"No, she's not living here answered, Viola."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0362.wav,8 kilometres it must be.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0363.wav,From the road a sudden shout of triumph.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0364.wav,"My dear little lady, you must not take the quotation literally."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0365.wav,What is it your Shakespeare says?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0366.wav,Ohh because they live close to the Earth and therefore despise it.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0367.wav,"Rather, under the lying garb of false masculinity."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0368.wav,What right have they even to question each other?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0369.wav,Fritz escaped the truly Christian trap by saying I asked you first.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0370.wav,"Being interpreted, it meant single file, which was distressing for Elsa and Fritz."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0371.wav,We marched in mass along the station Rd.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0372.wav,Duh. That child has such energy.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0373.wav,Allow me to introduce you to each other.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0374.wav,"Yes, nodding graciously to the advanced lady."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0375.wav,The frail professor is going to be one of us for the afternoon.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0376.wav,Shall we join the others?
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0377.wav,They only received the letters of blessing from their parents yesterday morning.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0378.wav,"For us, she said there will be a double joy."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0379.wav,You will not cry anymore or wake up in the night.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0380.wav,Such great big black trees on either side.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0381.wav,Once Upon a time she was walking along a little white Rd with O.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0382.wav,There was a little piece of candle burning in the enamel bracket.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0383.wav,They were laughing and holding each other by the hand.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0384.wav,"Standing on tiptoe in the yard, she almost felt she would be blown away."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0385.wav,That's why I'm not awake.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0386.wav,Don't guzzle it yourself or I'll know.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0387.wav,"Well, she's hooked a boy this time."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0388.wav,"He had have to force her out of it, that's all."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0389.wav,He began to plan a little trip for them.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0390.wav,"Well, once this boy business was over, she'd get stronger."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0391.wav,She certainly was a little thing.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0392.wav,"They stirred something in him, those bells, something vague and tender."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0393.wav,Asked Andreas loathing the man.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0394.wav,No time to indulge in pernicious little habits.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0395.wav,He took up a book and wheeled his armchair over to the window.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0396.wav,The doctor whistled a little tune and flicked the mayor again.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0397.wav,Tell me on the way up.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0398.wav,"On Sunday, a man has the right to expect his family."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0399.wav,It's partly the effect of Sunday.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0400.wav,"Two dogs sprawled in the middle of the road, scuffling and biting."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0401.wav,The gutters were choked with the leavings of Saturday night.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0402.wav,But the master gave her no opening.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0403.wav,She was full of terrified joy and importance in the goings on upstairs.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0404.wav,I suppose I'd better not disturb her.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0405.wav,There was a gentle knock at the door and his mother came in.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0406.wav,He repeated it quickly several times with a snapping movement of the jaws.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0407.wav,"What are you going to do this afternoon? Fraud line, Anna?"
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0408.wav,Fancy she has a separate plate for each of her front teeth.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0409.wav,She turned round and leaned on one elbow.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0410.wav,It makes such a pleasant excursion for a fine Saturday afternoon.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0411.wav,A high wooden wall compasses us all about.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0412.wav,"I think it must be the umbrellas, which make us look ridiculous."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0413.wav,Here was someone beside her laughing too.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0414.wav,"But the outer door suddenly opening, she sprang to her feet and laughed."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0415.wav,She brushed out her long hair and gathered it in her hands.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0416.wav,"Well you are a funny one, she said."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0417.wav,"You go downstairs, leave me alone."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0418.wav,Sabina took on the extra work without any thought of extra pay.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0419.wav,It meant an extra half hour in bed for her.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0420.wav,And I do not see any possible light out of this darkness.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0421.wav,But what a bother said I.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0422.wav,"Thus, the modern soul and I found ourselves together under the stars."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0423.wav,My spirit starves for want of that.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0424.wav,He was off duty and intended to show it.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0425.wav,Then presumably the winged shaft struck her collar broach.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0426.wav,"Yes, I know you have no love for me and no, forget me not."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0427.wav,"What do you intend to recite for our Lion, Sonia?"
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0428.wav,I forget nothing. Mama answered Sonia.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0429.wav,"My lamented husband, your father, Sonia, knew a great deal about England."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0430.wav,But the tragedy of the story is this.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0431.wav,The conversation is not out of your depth.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0432.wav,I have been making music for them on my trombone.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0433.wav,The children were all soundly sleeping.
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0434.wav,"God, the trouble you gave me."
uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0435.wav,"He tilted back in his chair, chuckling with laughter."
