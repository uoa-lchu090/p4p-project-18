1170,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0110.wav,Which resolution comforted her absolutely.
1171,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0112.wav,"Naturally, absent from home one must expect much discomfort and strange food."
1172,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0113.wav,"Poverty-stricken, her limbs with tattered rags half covered."

1180,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0124.wav,"A Lady with a Box of Sardines, said Dennis gravely."
1181,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0125.wav,She was sitting in the open taxi outside.
1182,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0126.wav,I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of cocoa in the tin.

1187,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0133.wav,"The bell jangled, the red serge curtains parted, and Mrs. Stubbs appeared."
1188,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0134.wav,Pity to have made herself so conspicuous.
1189,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0136.wav,"Linda saw that river, very wide, covered with little rafts and boats."
1190,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0137.wav,"She was a long, strange-looking woman with narrow hands and feet."
1191,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0138.wav,First man in as usual.
1192,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0140.wav,How could the poor darling help not having any money.

1205,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0157.wav,Nothing rested him so much then as for me to stroke his head.

1207,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0160.wav,"But they are beautifully kept, said the sister of the Baroness shyly."
1208,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0161.wav,But she graciously suffered our worship and we were more than content.
1209,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0162.wav,I found myself pitying the Baron.
1210,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0164.wav,"No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and such lips."
1211,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0165.wav,"Ah, Harold was too handsome, too handsome by far."
1212,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0166.wav,Harold hadn't come back from lunch until close on four.
1213,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0168.wav,"No, she said, I won't go outside."
1214,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0169.wav,How strange she'd never thought of it like that before.
1215,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0170.wav,They sat outside the house in long chairs under coloured parasols.
1216,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0172.wav,"He touched her cool hand, her cool cheek."
1217,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0173.wav,It would frighten Ethel out of her life.
1218,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0174.wav,She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too.
1219,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0176.wav,"She put the big, frothing cups before them and pushed across my clear glass."
1220,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0177.wav,When a faint violin sounded she winced and bit her lip again.
1221,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0178.wav,"Calm yourself, she said superbly."
1222,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0180.wav,"He tried to smile, to say I'm glad."
1223,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0181.wav,"It is to-morrow that you're going, isn't it."
1224,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0182.wav,"But his luck gave him a nasty jar, to say the least, almost immediately."
1225,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0184.wav,But at that moment in the street below a barrel-organ struck up.
1226,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0185.wav,They're such awfully nice men.
1227,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0186.wav,The very idea made one shudder.
1228,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0188.wav,She had no idea that he was grey.
1229,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0189.wav,That's a more intolerable situation than the other.
1230,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0190.wav,"But Jonathan only answered, A little love, a little kindness."
1231,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0192.wav,He could not be disloyal.
1232,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0193.wav,And when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour.
1233,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0194.wav,"They were the Trout boys, Pip and Rags."
1234,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0196.wav,You haven't been using it to poke the kitchen fire with by any chance.
1235,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0197.wav,Their cry sounded in the dreams of little children.
1236,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0198.wav,And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist.
1237,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0200.wav,"Why, even a prostitute has a greater sense of generosity."
1238,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0201.wav,He paused by the window and glanced at her a moment over his shoulder.
1239,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0202.wav,What does the pussy cat do all day.
1240,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0204.wav,"They had looked at each other, stunned with the conflict and sympathised."
1241,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0205.wav,I know no such name in a sharp voice.
1242,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0206.wav,You look like a little boy with your hair blowing about in the wind.
1243,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0208.wav,"As you please, said the landlord, obviously scorning us."
1244,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0209.wav,But by that time she had to peg out the washing for the Frau.
1245,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0210.wav,"Shouted Hans, hitting Anton over the head with his empty cup."
1246,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0212.wav,He wore an immense geranium flower stuck in the lapel of his coat.
1247,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0213.wav,Straightway Andreas felt that he was being accused.
1248,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0214.wav,"From the pine forest streamed a wild perfume, the branches swayed together, rhythmically, sonorously."
1249,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0216.wav,"Oh, I spend the day here now, she answered."
1250,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0217.wav,"What a fire, she shrieked, stretching out her hands."
1251,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0218.wav,"Oh, mamma, please don't say such things, Sonia flushed and grew very angry."
1252,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0220.wav,This is my little English friend of whom I have spoken.
1253,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0221.wav,Such a clout on the ear as you gave me.
1254,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0222.wav,Her roughened hands clasped and unclasped themselves in the folds of her skirt.
1255,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0224.wav,You must tuck the ends into your boots until we get there.
1256,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0225.wav,"But I consider child-bearing the most ignominious of all professions, I said."
1257,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0226.wav,I said he was a sea-captain on a long and perilous voyage.
1258,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0228.wav,A chestnut tree pushed green boughs against the window.
1259,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0229.wav,I am not accustomed to such company.
1260,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0230.wav,He and Frau Fischer were old friends.
1261,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0232.wav,Her high-born reply was what interested me.
1262,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0233.wav,Youth should be like a wild rose.
1263,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0234.wav,Coffee and rolls took on the nature of an orgy.
1264,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0236.wav,"I really do not know, I answered."
1265,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0237.wav,I assure you we are not afraid.
1266,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0238.wav,How long are you remaining here.
1267,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0240.wav,I have not eaten meat for three years.
1268,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0241.wav,My lady put me into collars and cuffs from the first.
1269,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0242.wav,They were ever so kind to me.
1270,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0244.wav,But it's always boiling before my lady is half through.
1271,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0245.wav,She looked at Ethel over her spectacles.
1272,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0246.wav,The carriage gates were pushed back.
1273,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0248.wav,They are eagerly bought by the soldiers.
1274,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0249.wav,"She lay on his breast, but so lightly, so remotely."
1275,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0250.wav,He bent over her and she looked up with her familiar half-smile.
1276,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0252.wav,He was something between the sheep-dog and the shepherd.
1277,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0253.wav,As much expression as you can put into it.
1278,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0254.wav,"The willow trees, outside the high, narrow windows, waved in the wind."
1279,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0256.wav,And when Leila compared him with her other partners he looked shabby.
1280,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0257.wav,It gave her quite a shock again to see how old he was.
1281,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0258.wav,Drawled a faint voice close to her ear.
1282,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0260.wav,There was a joyful flutter among the girls.
1283,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0261.wav,"Strange voices answered, Of course, my dear."
1284,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0262.wav,"It must have had a knock, somehow."
1285,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0264.wav,"There, lying to one side on an immense bed, lay grandpa."
1286,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0265.wav,"But grandma remembered too, at the same time."
1287,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0266.wav,Such a very nice stewardess came to meet them.
1288,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0268.wav,He clasped grandma in his arms and pressed her to him.
1289,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0269.wav,Beside him her grandma bustled along in her crackling black ulster.
1290,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0270.wav,"Look here, said William, how are we going to sit."
1291,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0272.wav,You think they are another bad sign.
1292,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0273.wav,We are inclined to reconsider.
1293,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0274.wav,Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed.
1294,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0276.wav,Will you stay in the car while I go and look.
1295,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0277.wav,And then we were outside again.
1296,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0278.wav,"I sipped my tea, leaned back, and even asked if I might smoke."
1297,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0280.wav,How can you talk of cutting off now.
1298,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0281.wav,"Oh, if you only knew how horrid I feel."
1299,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0282.wav,"And where are you going, if your mother may ask."
1300,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0284.wav,"Well, we can't postpone it again, said Josephine."
1301,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0285.wav,"Oh, eggs in various forms."
1302,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0286.wav,"And this time, said Josephine firmly, we must come to a definite decision."
1303,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0288.wav,"Asked Josephine, trying to begin to concentrate."
1304,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0289.wav,I'm afraid I shan't be able to stay very long with grandfather.
1305,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0290.wav,But we mustn't let you off with that.
1306,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0292.wav,The cab was dreadfully stuffy.
1307,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0293.wav,She heard his stick thumping.
1308,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0294.wav,"We can't disturb Kate again, she said softly."
1309,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0296.wav,He was given up to his dream.
1310,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0297.wav,Run down just as you are.
1311,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0298.wav,And somehow that seemed quite the best plan.
1312,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0300.wav,What's given you such a colour.
1313,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0301.wav,Jose began to be seriously annoyed.
1314,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0302.wav,But still one must go everywhere.
1315,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0304.wav,She looked mournfully and enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in.
1316,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0305.wav,Let's try over 'This life is Weary.'
1317,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0306.wav,But at that moment Mrs. Sheridan joined them.
1318,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0308.wav,How very nice workmen were.
1319,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0309.wav,But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men.
1320,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0310.wav,You enjoy yourself while you're young.
1321,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0312.wav,My very own for ever.
1322,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0313.wav,"Oh, what a joy it is to own things."
1323,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0314.wav,I've had the hell of a day.
1324,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0316.wav,I must go seek those heirs to my fame and fortune.
1325,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0317.wav,"No guiding principle, let us call it."
1326,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0318.wav,I'm exactly like that insect again.
1327,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0320.wav,"He was always full of new ideas, schemes, plans."
1328,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0321.wav,"Would ye have me laugh, my fair sister."
1329,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0322.wav,"It must be awful, she said slowly."
1330,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0324.wav,The gorgeous sunset had blazed and died.
1331,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0325.wav,Whatever did we shut the door for.
1332,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0326.wav,Alice did wish there'd been a bit of life on the road though.
1333,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0328.wav,But still her grandma was silent.
1334,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0329.wav,"Grandma, she said in a startled voice."
1335,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0330.wav,"And how strong, how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot sun."
1336,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0332.wav,"But she checked herself and said to the boy coldly, I don't like babies."
1337,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0333.wav,The boy had turned over.
1338,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0334.wav,And she gave her strange neighing laugh and grimaced at the other women.
1339,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0336.wav,He ignored his wife just as she ignored him.
1340,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0337.wav,But aren't you going to bathe here.
1341,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0338.wav,Then the children were unbuttoned.
1342,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0340.wav,The little girls ran into the paddock like chickens let out of a coop.
1343,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0341.wav,There was no man to disturb them.
1344,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0342.wav,Their very voices were changed as they called to one another.
1345,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0344.wav,"She smiled, and a look of deep content shone in her eyes."
1346,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0345.wav,He only woke up once last night.
1347,./training/Mansfield_train/uoa_nz_mansfield_sh_0346.wav,They settled themselves on the bench opposite Stanley and Beryl.
